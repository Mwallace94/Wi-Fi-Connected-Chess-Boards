Electrical System:

	Overview:

		- Powered by a Cypress ARM Cortex-M microcontroller and ESP8266 WiFi module.
		- The microcontroller reads and writes to IO blocks which power the peripherals.
		- The microcontroller and physical hardware will be interfaced with special circuitry.
		- WiFi module acts as bridge between the microcontroller and server.
		- WiFi module and microcontroller communicate over a serial bus.

	Peripherals

		- Reed switches will determine if a piece is on a chess space or not.
		- Stepper motors and an electromagnet will be used to move the chess pieces.
		- Limit switches will provide homing information for the stepper motors.
		- An LCD display will show important information to the user.
		- A rotary encoder will allow the user to interface with the board.

	Where We're At:

		- Schematic has been designed and reviewed.
		- Circuit has been layed out on a printed circuit board.

	What Needs To Be Done:

		- PCB's need to be ordered from manufacturer.
		- The circuit needs to be tested and verified.

Mechanical System:
	
	Overview:

		- An xy gantry will provide movement for the electromagnet and chess pieces.
		- Two stepper motors will control movement on the gantry.
		- An h-bot style gantry will be used to save vertical space.

	What Needs To Be Done:

		- The gantry needs to be designed and tested.
		- Chess board dimensions need to be determined.
